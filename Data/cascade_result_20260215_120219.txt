CASCADE PREDICTIONS (1 chains)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Chain 1: Critical flood
    → Step 1: Disruption of healthcare services
      Domain: flood | Probability: High | Timeframe: 0-6 hours
      Mechanism: Floodwaters inundate hospitals and healthcare facilities, causing power outages and damage to equipment.
    → Step 2: Increased risk of waterborne diseases
      Domain: pandemic | Probability: Medium | Timeframe: 1-3 days
      Mechanism: Contaminated floodwaters increase the risk of waterborne diseases, which can spread quickly in a disrupted healthcare environment.
    Historical precedent: Hurricane Katrina (2005), which caused widespread flooding and disruption of healthcare services, leading to an increased risk of waterborne diseases.
    Ultimate impact: Increased risk of waterborne diseases and disruption of healthcare services, potentially leading to a significant increase in morbidity and mortality.
    Affected: The entire population of Boston, Massachusetts, with a potential impact of hundreds of thousands of people.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RECOMMENDED ACTIONS (2)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  P1 [IMMEDIATE]: Activate emergency response plans and deploy resources to support flood response and healthcare services.
    Responsible: City of Boston Emergency Management Agency
    Rationale: Immediate action is necessary to mitigate the impact of the flood and prevent a cascade of events that could lead to a significant increase in morbidity and mortality.
  P2 [SHORT_TERM]: Conduct water quality testing and implement measures to prevent the spread of waterborne diseases.
    Responsible: Boston Water and Sewer Commission
    Rationale: Preventing the spread of waterborne diseases is critical to mitigating the impact of the flood and preventing a cascade of events that could lead to a significant increase in morbidity and mortality.
